# Initialize

Terraform fetches the plugins required to interact with the cloud provider defined by
our `main.tf` once when we initialize. To initialize, enter the following command:
```
terraform init
```

The initialization is specific to the folder where you are currently located.
The initialization process looks at all `.tf` files and fetches the plugins required
to build the resources defined in these files. If you replace some or all
`.tf` files inside a folder that has already been initialized, just call the command
again to make sure you have all plugins.

The initialization process creates a `.terraform` folder at the root of your current
folder. You do not need to look at its content for now.
