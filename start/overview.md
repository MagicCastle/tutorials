# Overview

Magic Castle uses the open-source software Terraform and HashiCorp Language (HCL) to define the virtual machines, volumes, and networks that are required to replicate a virtual HPC infrastructure. The infrastructure definition is packaged as a Terraform module that users can customize as they require.

In this this tutorial we will:
- Install Terraform
- Familiarize ourselves with the Terraform CLI
- Configure Terraform's access to the cloud provider API
- Download the latest Magic Castle release
- Create our first HPC cluster
